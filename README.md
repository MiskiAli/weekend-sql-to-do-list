# SQL To Do List App

## Description
 duration: 12 hours
 I made this to-do list application to help users organize and keep track of tasks they would want to complete. I built a method for users to create tasks on the front end. The task will be saved inside a database once it has been generated. The front end should update each time a Task is generated to display all tasks that still need to be finished. There are two options for each Task: "Task Completed" and "Delete." The  task will then change when it is finished. A Task can be deleted to remove it from the database as well as the front end.
